# üî• Predicting Fire Hotspots in the DRC: A Data-Driven Approach

This project focuses on understanding and predicting the dynamics of **fires and burned areas** across the **Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)**. Fires, whether natural, intentional, or wild, significantly impact ecosystems, air quality, and contribute to CO2 emissions. By analyzing historical fire data and associated environmental and demographic factors, the project aims to develop predictive models that can forecast burned areas, offering valuable insights for sustainable land management and disaster mitigation.

## üåç Project Overview
Each year, thousands of fires sweep across Africa, releasing CO2 and smoke that harm ecosystems and human health. These fires can be influenced by various factors, including:
- Natural fire cycles benefiting dryland ecosystems.
- Human activities like land clearing and agricultural preparation.
- Wildfires that cause significant destruction.

Understanding the **where and when** of fire occurrences and predicting their dynamics under changing climatic conditions are crucial for mitigating their effects. This project:
1. Aggregates burned area data across the DRC from **April 2000 to December 2013**.
2. Incorporates environmental and demographic data such as **rainfall, temperature, and population density**.
3. Builds predictive models to forecast burned areas during the **2014‚Äì2016 test period**.

## üîç Insights, Results & Why This Matters

### Historical Trends:
Identified key drivers of burned areas, such as rainfall and population density, which influence fire occurrence and severity across different regions in the DRC.

### Model Performance:
Achieved accurate predictions for the 2014‚Äì2016 test period using algorithms like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. The model was able to predict the areas most at risk for fires, providing a reliable forecast for future occurrences.

### Actionable Insights:
Provided strategies for fire mitigation, better land-use planning, and improved climate adaptation measures. The predictive model can assist in policy decisions related to fire management, land clearing, and urban resilience.

### Why This Matters:
- **Environmental Impact**: Fires are a major source of CO2 emissions and ecosystem damage, contributing to global warming and biodiversity loss.
- **Air Quality**: Smoke from fires affects millions of people living downwind, contributing to respiratory issues and deteriorating public health.
- **Policy Implications**: Predictive models can inform policies related to fire management, urban planning, and climate adaptation, improving resilience to the devastating effects of wildfires.
